## Overview of the project (This project contain only part of the system only) 🔍🔍🔍🔍
This Java Swing project revolves around a Car Customization and Purchasing system tailored for a specific section within the Porsche Company. It's designed using advanced data structures and algorithms.
Here's how it works: Customers visit their local Porsche branch where they can personalize their dream car within their budget. Once they're satisfied with the customization, they can place an order. The system then tracks the order progress, informing customers of the expected delivery time to their local branch. To confirm the order, customers make an advance payment.
Additionally, the local Porsche branch can access a list of completed orders for efficient management.
Customers begin by selecting their preferred vehicle model and then have the freedom to customize various aspects such as body color, rims, seats, and lights. Upon completion, they can review the total bill, including the individual prices of each customized part.
Overall, this project offers a seamless and professional experience for customers to personalize and purchase their ideal Porsche car.
